Dialogue: 1,0:03:36.95,0:03:40.67,720CN,,0,0,0,,因为它将所有的逻辑封装了起来。这是有人过来说：
Dialogue: 2,0:03:36.95,0:03:40.67,720EN,,0,0,0,,because it encapsulates all this logic and then somebody comes around

Dialogue: 2,0:04:06.70,0:04:12.67,720EN,but I have a different use case,0,0,0,,and all it's going to take is for you to add above equals true, so easy right
Dialogue: 1,0:04:12.67,0:04:18.17,720CN,but I have a different use case,0,0,0,,如果你想尽量简洁，你可以不管JSX v2的规范，你可以直接写above就可以了
Dialogue: 2,0:04:12.67,0:04:18.17,720EN,but I have a different use case,0,0,0,,and if you want to be super terse and you don't care about JSX of version 2 then you can just say above all by itself
Dialogue: 1,0:04:18.17,0:04:20.90,720CN,but I have a different use case,0,0,0,,而不用写above=，还能更简单嘛
Dialogue: 2,0:04:18.17,0:04:20.90,720EN,but I have a different use case,0,0,0,,and you don't need the equals true how easy could it be
Dialogue: 1,0:04:21.32,0:04:25.95,720CN,but I have a different use case,0,0,0,,然后你自我感觉良好，你开发了以个组件，并且开始有人使用它了
Dialogue: 2,0:04:21.32,0:04:25.95,720EN,but I have a different use case,0,0,0,,and so you're feeling pretty good about this like you've built something people are starting to use it
Dialogue: 1,0:04:25.95,0:04:31.62,720CN,but I have a different use case,0,0,0,,然后有个人过来说：嘿，我看到你的改动了，现在可以支持向上展开和向下展开
Dialogue: 2,0:04:25.95,0:04:31.62,720EN,but I have a different use case,0,0,0,,and then somebody says hey I saw how you changed it so it could support above and below
Dialogue: 1,0:04:31.62,0:04:38.22,720CN,but I have a different use case,0,0,0,,但我需要向右展开，你觉得可以吗？能做吗？

Dialogue: 2,0:04:38.22,0:04:43.05,720EN,but I have a different use case,0,0,0,,and you say yeah sure we can do that just right=true and now we just have some conditional logic
Dialogue: 1,0:04:43.05,0:04:47.42,720CN,but I have a different use case,0,0,0,,我们需要重写一点样式，之前我们用flexbox，我们打算用css grid
Dialogue: 2,0:04:43.05,0:04:47.42,720EN,but I have a different use case,0,0,0,,we have to rewrite it a little bit because it was flexbox before and now we're going to do CSS grid
Dialogue: 1,0:04:47.42,0:04:53.27,720CN,but I have a different use case,0,0,0,,css grid autoflow column就可以了。这样就实现了，太神奇了。谢谢你css grid把一切变得这么简单
Dialogue: 2,0:04:47.42,0:04:53.27,720EN,but I have a different use case,0,0,0,,grid autoflow column and now like magic it's so easy Thank You CSS grid for making that easy to do

Dialogue: 2,0:04:59.70,0:05:03.40,720EN,but I have a different use case,0,0,0,,and I have some conditional logic as you're adding these features
Dialogue: 1,0:05:03.40,0:05:09.12,720CN,but I have a different use case,0,0,0,,为了让自己感觉好些，你加了一些测试。当然你用的是react testing library
Dialogue: 2,0:05:03.40,0:05:09.12,720EN,but I have a different use case,0,0,0,,you have to add some tests to feel comfortable with with things and of course you're using react testing library
Dialogue: 1,0:05:09.12,0:05:12.97,720CN,but I have a different use case,0,0,0,,但即使这样，你还是感觉有点不舒服
Dialogue: 2,0:05:09.12,0:05:12.97,720EN,but I have a different use case,0,0,0,,but even with that you're starting to make you feel a little uncomfortable

Dialogue: 1,0:06:27.37,0:06:32.20,720CN,but I have a different use case,0,0,0,,你说：应该可以吧，我不动render方法
Dialogue: 2,0:06:27.37,0:06:32.20,720EN,but I have a different use case,0,0,0,,and you say yeah I guess so like I leave my render method as it is I don't need to touch that
Dialogue: 1,0:06:32.20,0:06:37.25,720CN,but I have a different use case,0,0,0,,我只需要改click事件的回调方法

Dialogue: 2,0:06:37.25,0:06:41.70,720EN,but I have a different use case,0,0,0,,you say okay just a little if statement to make that possible
Dialogue: 1,0:06:41.70,0:06:45.30,720CN,but I have a different use case,0,0,0,,现在我们可以每次只展开一条了，还不赖
Dialogue: 2,0:06:41.70,0:06:45.30,720EN,but I have a different use case,0,0,0,,and now we can only open one at a time that wasn't that wasn't all that bad
Dialogue: 1,0:06:45.30,0:06:49.00,720CN,but I have a different use case,0,0,0,,在组件上加上single=true，可以，没什么大不了的
Dialogue: 2,0:06:45.30,0:06:49.00,720EN,but I have a different use case,0,0,0,,now we have the single true and that's that's fine no big deal

Dialogue: 2,0:07:17.52,0:07:21.30,720EN,but I have a different use case,0,0,0,,so now you have a bunch of conditional logic in your render method
Dialogue: 1,0:07:21.30,0:07:23.80,720CN,but I have a different use case,0,0,0,,你在click回调函数里也有一些条件判断

Dialogue: 2,0:07:33.25,0:07:41.15,720EN,but I have a different use case,0,0,0,,can I combine that with opening only one eye so I can only open one at a time but I can't closd it
Dialogue: 1,0:07:41.15,0:07:46.67,720CN,but I have a different use case,0,0,0,,能实现吗？你说，可以的能实现

Dialogue: 2,0:07:46.67,0:07:52.85,720EN,but I have a different use case,0,0,0,,so I can't close this and I can only open one at a time you just use both of the prompts and so you're so happy
Dialogue: 1,0:07:53.15,0:07:56.75,720CN,but I have a different use case,0,0,0,,这个功能不费力就实现了
Dialogue: 2,0:07:53.15,0:07:56.75,720EN,but I have a different use case,0,0,0,,because just naturally out of nowhere that actually it's supported
Dialogue: 1,0:07:56.75,0:08:02.45,720CN,but I have a different use case,0,0,0,,然后你就想，太好了，我再也不用作出任何修改因为它支持世界上所有的用例了

Dialogue: 2,0:10:48.95,0:10:56.20,720EN,but I have a different use case,0,0,0,,so here the reasons why this is a problem beyond just like feeling frustrated yourself and always having to come back to this accordion that's getting worse and worse
Dialogue: 1,0:10:56.67,0:11:03.85,720CN,but I have a different use case,0,0,0,,组件打包后体积变大，性能下降。最开始我们写了个简单的折叠菜单，只有30行
Dialogue: 2,0:10:56.67,0:11:03.85,720EN,but I have a different use case,0,0,0,,bundle size and perf take a hit so initially we made like this 30 lines accordion component that was so simple
Dialogue: 1,0:11:04.50,0:11:12.75,720CN,but I have a different use case,0,0,0,,代码很简单，之后为了支持所有的用例，代码增加到了200到500行
Dialogue: 2,0:11:04.50,0:11:12.75,720EN,but I have a different use case,0,0,0,,and it's pretty small but now to support all of these use cases it's grown to 200 or 500 lines of code
Dialogue: 1,0:11:12.75,0:11:17.72,720CN,but I have a different use case,0,0,0,,而在你的应用中，你并不需要所有的用例，你只需要30行代码的实现
Dialogue: 2,0:11:12.75,0:11:17.72,720EN,but I have a different use case,0,0,0,,and in your app you don't like need that you need 30 of those lines
Dialogue: 1,0:11:17.72,0:11:22.67,720CN,but I have a different use case,0,0,0,,所以如果可以tree shaking组件就好了
Dialogue: 2,0:11:17.72,0:11:22.67,720EN,but I have a different use case,0,0,0,,so like if you could tree shake code within a component you would do that
Dialogue: 1,0:11:22.67,0:11:27.80,720CN,but I have a different use case,0,0,0,,但组件没法tree shaking所以你交付了大量的代码，但其中大部分用户并不需要
Dialogue: 2,0:11:22.67,0:11:27.80,720EN,but I have a different use case,0,0,0,,but you can't so you're shipping a ton of code to your users that you're never actually using
Dialogue: 1,0:11:27.80,0:11:32.87,720CN,but I have a different use case,0,0,0,,也许应用中其他模块会用到，也许根本不会用到
Dialogue: 2,0:11:27.80,0:11:32.87,720EN,but I have a different use case,0,0,0,,and in addition to that like maybe other parts of the app are using it but maybe entirely different apps are using it
Dialogue: 1,0:11:32.87,0:11:37.40,720CN,but I have a different use case,0,0,0,,他们成了你用例的受害者。so they're suffering for your use cases as well
Dialogue: 1,0:11:37.40,0:11:40.47,720CN,but I have a different use case,0,0,0,,还有代码维护的问题，维护这样的代码可不好玩
Dialogue: 2,0:11:37.40,0:11:40.47,720EN,but I have a different use case,0,0,0,,and then maintenance overhead this isn't like not really very fun to maintain
Dialogue: 1,0:11:40.47,0:11:48.77,720CN,but I have a different use case,0,0,0,,你需要写文档，回答用户关于所有props用法的问题
Dialogue: 2,0:11:40.47,0:11:48.77,720EN,but I have a different use case,0,0,0,,you have to worry about documentation you have to worry about answering people's questions about these different props that you're supporting
Dialogue: 1,0:11:48.77,0:11:58.60,720CN,but I have a different use case,0,0,0,,因为基本每个属性支持一个特定的用例，每次有新用例出现，你就加了一个新的属性
Dialogue: 2,0:11:48.77,0:11:58.60,720EN,but I have a different use case,0,0,0,,because they're all really kind of single use case specific and you add a new prop to every single use case that people come up with that you haven't thought of before
Dialogue: 1,0:11:59.40,0:12:09.25,720CN,but I have a different use case,0,0,0,,代码很难维护。开发的难度增加同时更容易出现bug
Dialogue: 2,0:11:59.40,0:12:09.25,720EN,but I have a different use case,0,0,0,,and so it's not fun to maintain. implementation complexity increases and that has an correlation with bugs that enter the code base
Dialogue: 1,0:12:09.25,0:12:14.05,720CN,but I have a different use case,0,0,0,,开始有人给你提交代码，肯定会有人提交他们用例的代码不是吗
Dialogue: 2,0:12:09.25,0:12:14.05,720EN,but I have a different use case,0,0,0,,so as people come in to contribute which of course you're going to have other people contribute their use cases right
Dialogue: 1,0:12:14.05,0:12:16.05,720CN,but I have a different use case,0,0,0,,因为你自己再也不想碰这些代码了
Dialogue: 2,0:12:14.05,0:12:16.05,720EN,but I have a different use case,0,0,0,,because you don't want to touch it anymore
Dialogue: 1,0:12:16.05,0:12:20.15,720CN,but I have a different use case,0,0,0,,但是他们开发时需要搞清楚所有已经支持的用例
Dialogue: 2,0:12:16.05,0:12:20.15,720EN,but I have a different use case,0,0,0,,but they have to learn about all the use cases that are already being supported
Dialogue: 1,0:12:20.15,0:12:27.22,720CN,but I have a different use case,0,0,0,,贡献代码变得更难，并且更容易出现bug，因为现在组件变得如此复杂
Dialogue: 2,0:12:20.15,0:12:27.22,720EN,but I have a different use case,0,0,0,,so it's harder to contribute and bugs sneak in a lot easier because this component is so complex
Dialogue: 1,0:12:27.82,0:12:35.90,720CN,but I have a different use case,0,0,0,,组件的接口也变的无比复杂，关于接口我最忍受不了的是
Dialogue: 2,0:12:27.82,0:12:35.90,720EN,but I have a different use case,0,0,0,,and the API this is probably my biggest beef with this props explosion that we're seeing here
Dialogue: 1,0:12:35.90,0:12:44.42,720CN,but I have a different use case,0,0,0,,你需要给每个属性加上文档，每个人在用你的组件之前需要了解每个属性
Dialogue: 2,0:12:35.90,0:12:44.42,720EN,but I have a different use case,0,0,0,,is you have to document each one of these prompts and everybody who comes in to use your component has to read every single one of those prompts
Dialogue: 1,0:12:44.42,0:12:50.15,720CN,but I have a different use case,0,0,0,,他们才知道每个属性是不是必须提供的，这不是什么好玩的事
Dialogue: 2,0:12:44.42,0:12:50.15,720EN,but I have a different use case,0,0,0,,to figure out whether those props are necessary for their use case and that is not fun
Dialogue: 1,0:12:50.22,0:12:55.25,720CN,but I have a different use case,0,0,0,,你给的例子永远是过期的，因为有新的属性可以更好的实现同样的功能
Dialogue: 2,0:12:50.22,0:12:55.25,720EN,but I have a different use case,0,0,0,,the examples are always out of date because now there's this new prop that does this better
Dialogue: 1,0:12:55.75,0:13:01.02,720CN,but I have a different use case,0,0,0,,于是每个人都很伤心
Dialogue: 2,0:12:55.75,0:13:01.02,720EN,but I have a different use case,0,0,0,,and so this all this just makes everybody sad and highlighted so now there we go
Dialogue: 1,0:13:02.87,0:13:09.32,720CN,but I have a different use case,0,0,0,,当我为准备这次演讲时，我在推特上做了个调查，你们可能有人参与过
Dialogue: 2,0:13:02.87,0:13:09.32,720EN,but I have a different use case,0,0,0,,so when I was researching for this talk I asked Twitter some of you may have responded
Dialogue: 1,0:13:09.32,0:13:14.90,720CN,but I have a different use case,0,0,0,,你用过的哪个组件有最多的props？
Dialogue: 2,0:13:09.32,0:13:14.90,720EN,but I have a different use case,0,0,0,,what is the reusable component that you've used that has the most number of props
Dialogue: 1,0:13:15.32,0:13:18.40,720CN,but I have a different use case,0,0,0,,获胜者是有60多个属性的组件，是开源的
Dialogue: 2,0:13:15.32,0:13:18.40,720EN,but I have a different use case,0,0,0,,and the winner was a 60 prop component that's open source
Dialogue: 1,0:13:18.40,0:13:20.40,720CN,but I have a different use case,0,0,0,,我不会说出它的名字因为这么做不太地道
Dialogue: 2,0:13:18.40,0:13:20.40,720EN,but I have a different use case,0,0,0,,I'm not going to name names because that would be mean
Dialogue: 1,0:13:20.65,0:13:26.47,720CN,but I have a different use case,0,0,0,,但是这个组件有60个属性，并且有些叫做“选项“，“配置”的属性
Dialogue: 2,0:13:20.65,0:13:26.47,720EN,but I have a different use case,0,0,0,,but it has 60 props and then there are some props that are specific like like options prompts
Dialogue: 1,0:13:26.47,0:13:29.25,720CN,but I have a different use case,0,0,0,,你骗不了任何人，这意味里面包含了更多的属性
Dialogue: 2,0:13:26.47,0:13:29.25,720EN,but I have a different use case,0,0,0,,which you're not kidding anybody those are just more props
Dialogue: 1,0:13:29.25,0:13:34.67,720CN,but I have a different use case,0,0,0,,“选项”属性中有30个可选项，等同于你加了30个属性到你的组件里面
Dialogue: 2,0:13:29.25,0:13:34.67,720EN,but I have a different use case,0,0,0,,it's like this object that has like 30 options like yeah you just added 30 props to your component
Dialogue: 1,0:13:35.17,0:13:43.30,720CN,but I have a different use case,0,0,0,,有个叫Jen的人回复了我的那条推特，说：“我把这叫做属性爆炸”
Dialogue: 2,0:13:35.17,0:13:43.30,720EN,but I have a different use case,0,0,0,,for all intents and purposes and somebody responded to that tweet and said her name's Jen Creighton I call that and a prop clips
Dialogue: 1,0:13:45.85,0:13:52.27,720CN,but I have a different use case,0,0,0,,谢谢Jen，通过创建一个新的标签让世界更美好
Dialogue: 2,0:13:45.85,0:13:52.27,720EN,but I have a different use case,0,0,0,,yeah Thank You Jen made the world a better place with a new hashtag
Dialogue: 1,0:13:53.27,0:14:00.55,720CN,but I have a different use case,0,0,0,,如果我告诉你之前展示的所有功能只用37行代码就可以实现呢？
Dialogue: 2,0:13:53.27,0:14:00.55,720EN,but I have a different use case,0,0,0,,so what if I told you all of those demos that you saw were built on the same 37 line component
Dialogue: 1,0:14:01.30,0:14:03.97,720CN,but I have a different use case,0,0,0,,支持所有的用例，但是只有37行代码
Dialogue: 2,0:14:01.30,0:14:03.97,720EN,but I have a different use case,0,0,0,,that supports all of those use cases in 37 lines
Dialogue: 1,0:14:04.52,0:14:07.37,720CN,but I have a different use case,0,0,0,,让我们来尝试下快速实现这些功能，使用37行代码
Dialogue: 2,0:14:04.52,0:14:07.37,720EN,but I have a different use case,0,0,0,,go ahead really quick try to implement the whole thing in 37 lines
Dialogue: 1,0:14:08.10,0:14:11.27,720CN,but I have a different use case,0,0,0,,好的，完成了吗？我们来看一下，做的好
Dialogue: 2,0:14:08.10,0:14:11.27,720EN,but I have a different use case,0,0,0,,okay are you done okay let's take a look good job
Dialogue: 1,0:14:13.02,0:14:16.87,720CN,,0,0,0,,我不希望你过多关注具体实现
Dialogue: 2,0:14:13.02,0:14:16.87,720EN,,0,0,0,,so I don't want you to focus too much on the specific implementation here
Dialogue: 1,0:14:17.55,0:14:26.15,720CN,but I have a different use case,0,0,0,,但是实现中运用了两种模式，带来了灵活性和简单性
Dialogue: 2,0:14:17.55,0:14:26.15,720EN,but I have a different use case,0,0,0,,but there are two patterns that exist in this implementation that enable this kind of flexibility and simplicity
Dialogue: 1,0:14:26.15,0:14:31.45,720CN,but I have a different use case,0,0,0,,我们会看如何更多的使用这个组件，首先我们使用了渲染属性模式
Dialogue: 2,0:14:26.15,0:14:31.45,720EN,but I have a different use case,0,0,0,,and we're going to look at how to use this component more but here we're using render props
Dialogue: 1,0:14:31.45,0:14:35.65,720CN,but I have a different use case,0,0,0,,这个模式最近在社区里非常流行，你可能也听说过
Dialogue: 2,0:14:31.45,0:14:35.65,720EN,but I have a different use case,0,0,0,,which have really taken steam in the community you've probably heard of them
Dialogue: 1,0:14:36.05,0:14:42.80,720CN,but I have a different use case,0,0,0,,通过渲染属性传递一个函数，我们直接调用它，并且将我们的状态和更新状态的逻辑传递过去
Dialogue: 2,0:14:36.05,0:14:42.80,720EN,but I have a different use case,0,0,0,,it's this stop props in we're just calling that as a function we pass it our state and a mechanism for updating our state
Dialogue: 1,0:14:43.10,0:14:45.95,720CN,but I have a different use case,0,0,0,,由用户决定他们想渲染什么内容
Dialogue: 2,0:14:43.10,0:14:45.95,720EN,but I have a different use case,0,0,0,,and now people can render whatever they like
Dialogue: 1,0:14:46.47,0:14:51.67,720CN,but I have a different use case,0,0,0,,我们还使用了state reducer模式，这个也许你不熟悉
Dialogue: 2,0:14:46.47,0:14:51.67,720EN,but I have a different use case,0,0,0,,and then we're also using a state reducer which is one you might not be familiar with
Dialogue: 1,0:14:52.15,0:15:00.70,720CN,but I have a different use case,0,0,0,,这个模式，使用户能够在状态更新前得到通知，并且能够修改将要更新的状态
Dialogue: 2,0:14:52.15,0:15:00.70,720EN,but I have a different use case,0,0,0,,and that enables users to change the state as it's being updated so it can modify how the state updates happen
Dialogue: 1,0:15:01.02,0:15:06.72,720CN,but I have a different use case,0,0,0,,这两种模式都是“控制反转”的实现
Dialogue: 2,0:15:01.02,0:15:06.72,720EN,but I have a different use case,0,0,0,,so both of these patterns are actually implementation of the concepts called inversion of control
Dialogue: 1,0:15:07.00,0:15:12.22,720CN,but I have a different use case,0,0,0,,“控制反转”的意思是，有些工作我们本来是交给库去完成
Dialogue: 2,0:15:07.00,0:15:12.22,720EN,but I have a different use case,0,0,0,,and what that basically means is normally with the library you're going to call into the library
Dialogue: 1,0:15:12.57,0:15:16.57,720CN,but I have a different use case,0,0,0,,就像你调用render方法渲染一个react组件
Dialogue: 2,0:15:12.57,0:15:16.57,720EN,but I have a different use case,0,0,0,,like you're gonna call to get to render a react components or something
Dialogue: 1,0:15:17.05,0:15:22.17,720CN,but I have a different use case,0,0,0,,控制反转是你使用的库反过来调用你的代码
Dialogue: 2,0:15:17.05,0:15:22.17,720EN,but I have a different use case,0,0,0,,inversion of control is where the library calls back into the user code
Dialogue: 1,0:15:22.17,0:15:27.30,720CN,but I have a different use case,0,0,0,,就像库对你说，“嘿，我要做这件事了，你想让我怎么做？”to say hey I'm going to be doing this thing, what do you want me to do about that?
Dialogue: 1,0:15:27.30,0:15:32.50,720CN,but I have a different use case,0,0,0,,你可以修改，我们看一眼demo
Dialogue: 2,0:15:27.30,0:15:32.50,720EN,but I have a different use case,0,0,0,,and you can make modifications to it so let's take a look at a demo
Dialogue: 1,0:15:32.50,0:15:37.50,720CN,but I have a different use case,0,0,0,,谢谢Eva开发了codesandbox，有人喜欢用codesandbox吗？
Dialogue: 2,0:15:32.50,0:15:37.50,720EN,but I have a different use case,0,0,0,,Thank You Eva's for codesandbox. who loves codesandbox?
Dialogue: 1,0:15:37.50,0:15:43.80,720CN,but I have a different use case,0,0,0,,codesandbox是最酷最酷的东西了
Dialogue: 2,0:15:37.50,0:15:43.80,720EN,but I have a different use case,0,0,0,,yeah this thing is the coolest the coolest thing
Dialogue: 1,0:15:43.80,0:15:54.05,720CN,but I have a different use case,0,0,0,,好的，这是我们的折叠菜单和基本折叠菜单，这是它的代码
Dialogue: 2,0:15:43.80,0:15:54.05,720EN,but I have a different use case,0,0,0,,okay so here's our accordion and our bass accordion is that component that you saw earlier so this is our implementation that builds out our accordion
Dialogue: 1,0:15:55.17,0:16:04.90,720CN,but I have a different use case,0,0,0,,对于基本折叠菜单，我们接受一些条目然后将剩下的props展开以便可以覆盖其中的一些属性
Dialogue: 2,0:15:55.17,0:16:04.90,720EN,but I have a different use case,0,0,0,,so with the bass accordion we're just accepting some items and then we spread the rest of the props so we can override some of the accordion or bass accordions prompts
Dialogue: 1,0:16:05.62,0:16:10.00,720CN,but I have a different use case,0,0,0,,于是折叠菜单的用户可以重写一个基本的折叠菜单属性
Dialogue: 2,0:16:05.62,0:16:10.00,720EN,but I have a different use case,0,0,0,,so the user of accordions and override the basic accordions props
Dialogue: 1,0:16:10.45,0:16:14.90,720CN,but I have a different use case,0,0,0,,然后我们将一个函数作为children传过去，或者使用渲染属性
Dialogue: 2,0:16:10.45,0:16:14.90,720EN,but I have a different use case,0,0,0,,and then we're providing our children as a function or our render prop
Dialogue: 1,0:16:15.57,0:16:18.37,720CN,but I have a different use case,0,0,0,,在children函数中我们得到了索引和条目
Dialogue: 2,0:16:15.57,0:16:18.37,720EN,but I have a different use case,0,0,0,,and that's taking our open indexes and our handle item quick
Dialogue: 1,0:16:18.37,0:16:21.30,720CN,but I have a different use case,0,0,0,,从这开始就完全是我们的责任了
Dialogue: 2,0:16:18.37,0:16:21.30,720EN,but I have a different use case,0,0,0,,and from there on out it's totally our responsibility
Dialogue: 1,0:16:21.97,0:16:29.47,720CN,but I have a different use case,0,0,0,,之前的API比这难用多了，对吗？
Dialogue: 2,0:16:21.97,0:16:29.47,720EN,but I have a different use case,0,0,0,,so this is actually a significantly like more difficult to use API than this right?
Dialogue: 1,0:16:29.77,0:16:33.47,720CN,but I have a different use case,0,0,0,,用户写的代码更多了，这就是控制反转
Dialogue: 2,0:16:29.77,0:16:33.47,720EN,but I have a different use case,0,0,0,,you have a lot more work to do this is what inversion of control is
Dialogue: 1,0:16:34.00,0:16:36.80,720CN,but I have a different use case,0,0,0,,让你有控制权同时有更多的责任
Dialogue: 2,0:16:34.00,0:16:36.80,720EN,but I have a different use case,0,0,0,,it's giving you control and responsibility
Dialogue: 1,0:16:37.27,0:16:45.00,720CN,,0,0,0,,但是通过复合组件模式，你可以像之前那样使用折叠菜单组件
Dialogue: 2,0:16:37.27,0:16:45.00,720EN,,0,0,0,,but because of reaction composition model you can actually now I can use this accordion like I used that first accordion
Dialogue: 1,0:16:45.47,0:16:52.80,720CN,but I have a different use case,0,0,0,,这是调用accordion，传给他一些条目，很酷的是我用复合组件模式来创建它
Dialogue: 2,0:16:45.47,0:16:52.80,720EN,but I have a different use case,0,0,0,,it's just call accordion. pass it some items and the cool thing about this is that I can use reaction composition model to create that
Dialogue: 1,0:16:53.10,0:16:59.15,720CN,but I have a different use case,0,0,0,,然后我可以添加更多的逻辑来支持所有的用例
Dialogue: 2,0:16:53.10,0:16:59.15,720EN,but I have a different use case,0,0,0,,and then I can keep adding more logic to this accordion to make it support all the different use cases we're talking about
Dialogue: 1,0:16:59.60,0:17:02.02,720CN,but I have a different use case,0,0,0,,同时一点不改基本折叠菜单组件
Dialogue: 2,0:16:59.60,0:17:02.02,720EN,but I have a different use case,0,0,0,,without making any changes to the basic accordion
Dialogue: 1,0:17:02.70,0:17:08.37,720CN,but I have a different use case,0,0,0,,这个做法很整洁是因为，如果新的折叠菜单组件如果不支持之前的用例
Dialogue: 2,0:17:02.70,0:17:08.37,720EN,but I have a different use case,0,0,0,,and why that is neat is because if this accordion doesn't support the use case that I have
Dialogue: 1,0:17:08.97,0:17:13.67,720CN,but I have a different use case,0,0,0,,我可以直接拷贝这些代码来自己写一个
Dialogue: 2,0:17:08.97,0:17:13.67,720EN,but I have a different use case,0,0,0,,I can just go copy all of this code and go make my own implementation
Dialogue: 1,0:17:14.07,0:17:19.65,720CN,but I have a different use case,0,0,0,,复制粘贴这种代码要不之前好多了，因为这些代码里没有逻辑
Dialogue: 2,0:17:14.07,0:17:19.65,720EN,but I have a different use case,0,0,0,,and this code to copy is actually pretty pretty straight for there's not a lot of logic going on
Dialogue: 1,0:17:19.65,0:17:26.45,720CN,but I have a different use case,0,0,0,,而且一共才37行代码，复制粘贴也不会让你觉得难受
Dialogue: 2,0:17:19.65,0:17:26.45,720EN,but I have a different use case,0,0,0,,and it's it's less painful to copy and in an accordion example like the accordions 37 lines
Dialogue: 1,0:17:26.90,0:17:32.10,720CN,but I have a different use case,0,0,0,,downshift的代码要远远多于37行
Dialogue: 2,0:17:26.90,0:17:32.10,720EN,but I have a different use case,0,0,0,,downshift for example is a lot longer than 37 lines of code
Dialogue: 1,0:17:32.60,0:17:39.20,720CN,but I have a different use case,0,0,0,,所以它里面有更多的代码可以复用，我们还可以复制这个特定的渲染逻辑
Dialogue: 2,0:17:32.60,0:17:39.20,720EN,but I have a different use case,0,0,0,,and so there's a lot more code that we can share there and then we can duplicate this specific rendering
Dialogue: 1,0:17:39.20,0:17:41.30,720CN,but I have a different use case,0,0,0,,这样就可以实现我们特殊的用例
Dialogue: 2,0:17:39.20,0:17:41.30,720EN,but I have a different use case,0,0,0,,so that we can have our specific use cases
Dialogue: 1,0:17:42.12,0:17:46.02,720CN,but I have a different use case,0,0,0,,之后比如说又有个同事过来说
Dialogue: 2,0:17:42.12,0:17:46.02,720EN,but I have a different use case,0,0,0,,so anyway let's say I build this thing and then the coworker comes and says
Dialogue: 1,0:17:46.02,0:17:55.00,720CN,but I have a different use case,0,0,0,,“嘿，Kent, 你的折叠菜单很酷，不过要怎样才能让内容向上展开呢？”
Dialogue: 2,0:17:46.02,0:17:55.00,720EN,but I have a different use case,0,0,0,,hey that's a pretty cool cool accordion you got there Kent what can I do about having it render the contents above the button
Dialogue: 1,0:17:55.00,0:18:01.95,720CN,but I have a different use case,0,0,0,,你说：“只要把emotion组件放在这里，这些只是加了样式的组件”
Dialogue: 2,0:17:55.00,0:18:01.95,720EN,but I have a different use case,0,0,0,,you say literally just take these emotion components these are just like style components like styled components kind of thing
Dialogue: 1,0:18:01.95,0:18:07.07,720CN,but I have a different use case,0,0,0,,“把这些组件移动到这里，完成了”
Dialogue: 2,0:18:01.95,0:18:07.07,720EN,but I have a different use case,0,0,0,,just take these components and move them and you're done
Dialogue: 1,0:18:08.02,0:18:13.15,720CN,but I have a different use case,0,0,0,,不算完成，因为小手图标的指向是错的
Dialogue: 2,0:18:08.02,0:18:13.15,720EN,but I have a different use case,0,0,0,,yeah you're not quite done because this emoji is pointing the wrong way
Dialogue: 1,0:18:13.15,0:18:17.70,720CN,but I have a different use case,0,0,0,,于是我们就让它指向上方，搞定了
Dialogue: 2,0:18:13.15,0:18:17.70,720EN,but I have a different use case,0,0,0,,so we'll just point up and now it's planes right way
Dialogue: 1,0:18:18.92,0:18:24.30,720CN,but I have a different use case,0,0,0,,这是Alfred，如果有人想知道，Alfred太酷了
Dialogue: 2,0:18:18.92,0:18:24.30,720EN,but I have a different use case,0,0,0,,that was Alfred somebody's going to ask me that was Alfred so cool
Dialogue: 1,0:18:24.30,0:18:26.92,720CN,but I have a different use case,0,0,0,,然后又有人说，我想把内容向左边展开， 可以了
Dialogue: 2,0:18:24.30,0:18:26.92,720EN,but I have a different use case,0,0,0,,and then somebody says hey I want to render it on the left - right
Dialogue: 1,0:18:26.92,0:18:34.60,720CN,but I have a different use case,0,0,0,,你回答说，这个菜单项是个emotion组件，这个组件仅仅是关于样式的，是用CSS grid实现的
Dialogue: 2,0:18:26.92,0:18:34.60,720EN,but I have a different use case,0,0,0,,then you say hey this accordion item is an emotion component that's like total style concern we're using CSS grid over there
Dialogue: 1,0:18:34.60,0:18:38.85,720CN,but I have a different use case,0,0,0,,所以如果你把方向改成水平它就会用css grid
Dialogue: 2,0:18:34.60,0:18:38.85,720EN,but I have a different use case,0,0,0,,so if you change direction to a horizontal then it's going to use CSS grid
Dialogue: 1,0:18:39.15,0:18:43.92,720CN,but I have a different use case,0,0,0,,加上grid: autoflow你就能让内容向着你想要的方向展开了
Dialogue: 2,0:18:39.15,0:18:43.92,720EN,but I have a different use case,0,0,0,,egg and grid autoflow column and now you can have things rendering the right direction
Dialogue: 1,0:18:43.92,0:18:51.45,720CN,but I have a different use case,0,0,0,,这里我们让小手指向这个方向，指向右
Dialogue: 2,0:18:43.92,0:18:51.45,720EN,but I have a different use case,0,0,0,,so here we'll move this hand pointing this way and then we'll have a whoops a point right
Dialogue: 1,0:18:52.70,0:18:56.52,720CN,but I have a different use case,0,0,0,,完成了，很酷是吧？
Dialogue: 2,0:18:52.70,0:18:56.52,720EN,but I have a different use case,0,0,0,,and tada! cool. right?
Dialogue: 1,0:18:56.52,0:19:01.12,720CN,but I have a different use case,0,0,0,,然后又有人说，等一下等一下，这是很酷，但我想让内容向另一边展开
Dialogue: 2,0:18:56.52,0:19:01.12,720EN,but I have a different use case,0,0,0,,and then if you want there's a like hold on down a hold on that's pretty cool but I need my contents on the other side
Dialogue: 1,0:19:01.12,0:19:03.12,720CN,,0,0,0,,没问题，完成了
Dialogue: 2,0:19:01.12,0:19:03.12,720EN,,0,0,0,,yep tada
Dialogue: 1,0:19:03.12,0:19:09.00,720CN,but I have a different use case,0,0,0,,接下来我们只需要将图标移到那边，当你能控制render方法时这很简单
Dialogue: 2,0:19:03.12,0:19:09.00,720EN,but I have a different use case,0,0,0,,and then we'll just move those emoji over there it's pretty easy when you have control over rendering right
Dialogue: 1,0:19:10.10,0:19:12.47,720CN,but I have a different use case,0,0,0,,你有控制权，可以做任何你想做的
Dialogue: 2,0:19:10.10,0:19:12.47,720EN,but I have a different use case,0,0,0,,you literally are in control, you do whatever you want to
Dialogue: 1,0:19:12.47,0:19:17.72,720CN,but I have a different use case,0,0,0,,你想要在标题里加上个hello？随便加
Dialogue: 2,0:19:12.47,0:19:17.72,720EN,but I have a different use case,0,0,0,,you want to have a little thing that says hello in the title it's all yours feel free
Dialogue: 1,0:19:17.72,0:19:20.70,720CN,but I have a different use case,0,0,0,,你想用有样式的组件代替emotion？可以
Dialogue: 2,0:19:17.72,0:19:20.70,720EN,but I have a different use case,0,0,0,,you want to use styled components instead of emotion?
Dialogue: 1,0:19:20.70,0:19:26.22,720CN,but I have a different use case,0,0,0,,或者你想用普通的css，都可以，权利在你手中
Dialogue: 2,0:19:20.70,0:19:26.22,720EN,but I have a different use case,0,0,0,,you want to use regular CSS that like all of that power is in your hands
Dialogue: 1,0:19:26.50,0:19:28.22,720CN,but I have a different use case,0,0,0,,这就是控制反转的威力that's the power of inversion of control
Dialogue: 1,0:19:28.75,0:19:33.70,720CN,but I have a different use case,0,0,0,,回到刚开始，有人过来跟你说：
Dialogue: 2,0:19:28.75,0:19:33.70,720EN,but I have a different use case,0,0,0,,so going back to our original when some that person comes to you and says
Dialogue: 1,0:19:33.70,0:19:37.22,720CN,but I have a different use case,0,0,0,,“嘿，我想要render的逻辑有些不同，我不能通过渲染属性实现”
Dialogue: 2,0:19:33.70,0:19:37.22,720EN,but I have a different use case,0,0,0,,hey I need the logic to be different now like I can't do that with the render prop
Dialogue: 1,0:19:37.55,0:19:42.65,720CN,but I have a different use case,0,0,0,,你说：“这就是我支持state reducer的原因” 我们有这个叫做single的函数，只有3行代码
Dialogue: 2,0:19:37.55,0:19:42.65,720EN,but I have a different use case,0,0,0,,you say that's why we have a state reducer so we have this three line function called single
Dialogue: 1,0:19:43.00,0:19:45.97,720CN,but I have a different use case,0,0,0,,我们来快速看一下它的代码
Dialogue: 2,0:19:43.00,0:19:45.97,720EN,but I have a different use case,0,0,0,,I wasn't going to show you but I'm gonna show you really quick single
Dialogue: 1,0:19:46.42,0:19:52.02,720CN,but I have a different use case,0,0,0,,在这里。哦我错了，是4行代码，我应该提前检查一下
Dialogue: 2,0:19:46.42,0:19:52.02,720EN,but I have a different use case,0,0,0,,single, there it is. okay it's four lines. I was wrong, I should have reviewed first
Dialogue: 1,0:19:52.02,0:19:55.90,720CN,but I have a different use case,0,0,0,,4行代码的函数，参数是当前状态，状态的改变
Dialogue: 2,0:19:52.02,0:19:55.90,720EN,but I have a different use case,0,0,0,,four line function that just takes your state, your changes
Dialogue: 1,0:19:55.90,0:20:00.77,720CN,but I have a different use case,0,0,0,,如果状态的类型是opening，我们就将open的索引改成只有一个
Dialogue: 2,0:19:55.90,0:20:00.77,720EN,but I have a different use case,0,0,0,,and if the state type is opening then we're going to change the open indexes to only have the one
Dialogue: 1,0:20:01.27,0:20:09.30,720CN,but I have a different use case,0,0,0,,防止关闭的功能也是类似的实现方法，如果点击关闭时我们有多于或者少于一个菜单项是展开的状态，就不会允许状态变成关闭
Dialogue: 2,0:20:01.27,0:20:09.30,720EN,but I have a different use case,0,0,0,,and then our prevent closed works in a similar way if we're closing and we have more than or less than one that are already open then will not allow that closed to happen
Dialogue: 1,0:20:10.50,0:20:19.47,720CN,but I have a different use case,0,0,0,,我们在这加一个state reducer然后将single函数放在这儿，这就可以了
Dialogue: 2,0:20:10.50,0:20:19.47,720EN,but I have a different use case,0,0,0,,so with that we can add a state reducer and we'll put single here and that's all it takes
Dialogue: 1,0:20:19.47,0:20:24.95,720CN,but I have a different use case,0,0,0,,借用昨天一些内容。很酷，太简单了
Dialogue: 2,0:20:19.47,0:20:24.95,720EN,but I have a different use case,0,0,0,,to borrow something from shortly yesterday. so cool. that's pretty easy
Dialogue: 1,0:20:19.47,0:20:26.85,720CN,but I have a different use case,0,0,0,,这就是防止关闭的实现，酷
Dialogue: 2,0:20:19.47,0:20:26.85,720EN,but I have a different use case,0,0,0,,well what about prevent close cool
Dialogue: 1,0:20:28.42,0:20:33.27,720CN,but I have a different use case,0,0,0,,现在我不能关闭这个菜单项，但是我可以展开多个，然后这个就可以关闭了
Dialogue: 2,0:20:28.42,0:20:33.27,720EN,but I have a different use case,0,0,0,,now I can't close this one but I can open multiple and then I can close this one
Dialogue: 1,0:20:34.72,0:20:41.77,720CN,but I have a different use case,0,0,0,,只要写点简单的js就可以将这些功能结合起来，就可以做到结合reducer和防止关闭
Dialogue: 2,0:20:34.72,0:20:41.77,720EN,but I have a different use case,0,0,0,,yeah and then to combine those it's just some more a little bit of JavaScript here that will prove combined reducers single and prevent close
Dialogue: 1,0:20:42.62,0:20:46.85,720CN,but I have a different use case,0,0,0,,我同时支持两个功能，我不能全部关闭，可以同时开多个。酷
Dialogue: 2,0:20:42.62,0:20:46.85,720EN,but I have a different use case,0,0,0,,and I would get both of those functionality I can't close it and I can open it. cool.
Dialogue: 1,0:20:48.42,0:20:55.30,720CN,but I have a different use case,0,0,0,,好，现在利用这种组合模式，我可以实现标签页组件
Dialogue: 2,0:20:48.42,0:20:55.30,720EN,but I have a different use case,0,0,0,,right so now with reacts composition model I can actually create a tabs component
Dialogue: 1,0:20:55.95,0:21:01.95,720CN,but I have a different use case,0,0,0,,封装好这些reducers，这样作为标签页的用户我不需要再考虑这些了
Dialogue: 2,0:20:55.95,0:21:01.95,720EN,but I have a different use case,0,0,0,,to kind of encapsulate those reducers so I don't have to think about those reducers as a user of the tabs component
Dialogue: 1,0:21:01.95,0:21:08.57,720CN,but I have a different use case,0,0,0,,于是现在你有了这个基本的标签页组件传递结合的reducer里面包含single和不允许关闭所有的逻辑
Dialogue: 2,0:21:01.95,0:21:08.57,720EN,but I have a different use case,0,0,0,,so now you have this basic tabs that passes combined reducers for single and prevent closed
Dialogue: 1,0:21:08.92,0:21:16.32,720CN,but I have a different use case,0,0,0,,如果你想，你还可以开发自己的state reducer传给组件，实现更多可定制的内容
Dialogue: 2,0:21:08.92,0:21:16.32,720EN,but I have a different use case,0,0,0,,and the state reducer that you can provide if you want to so you can even add more customization on the base tabs if you want to
Dialogue: 1,0:21:17.32,0:21:20.65,720CN,but I have a different use case,0,0,0,,很不错。我们把这些应用在标签页组件中
Dialogue: 2,0:21:17.32,0:21:20.65,720EN,but I have a different use case,0,0,0,,so that's pretty neat. let's go ahead and well use that in our tabs
Dialogue: 1,0:21:20.65,0:21:24.32,720CN,but I have a different use case,0,0,0,,我们有基本标签页组件让我们渲染成标签页而不是折叠菜单
Dialogue: 2,0:21:20.65,0:21:24.32,720EN,but I have a different use case,0,0,0,,here we have base tabs so let me render tabs instead of the accordion
Dialogue: 1,0:21:27.12,0:21:29.12,720CN,but I have a different use case,0,0,0,,现在我们有标签页组件了
Dialogue: 2,0:21:27.12,0:21:29.12,720EN,but I have a different use case,0,0,0,,and now we've got our tabs tada
Dialogue: 1,0:21:30.40,0:21:37.40,720CN,,0,0,0,,这里我们创建一个基本标签页组件就像在折叠菜单中用到的一样。谁明白为什么呢，我们甚至都没有用类实现
Dialogue: 2,0:21:30.40,0:21:37.40,720EN,,0,0,0,,and here we're using base tabs just like we use the accordion but as far as we're concerned like who knows what's going on we're not even using class components here
Dialogue: 1,0:21:37.95,0:21:42.65,720CN,but I have a different use case,0,0,0,,这一切只是react的复合组件模式
Dialogue: 2,0:21:37.95,0:21:42.65,720EN,but I have a different use case,0,0,0,,it's all just react beautiful composition model we've grown to love
Dialogue: 1,0:21:43.47,0:21:51.30,720CN,but I have a different use case,0,0,0,,使用标签页组件时。我们接收这些条目，map他们，得到按钮和菜单内容
Dialogue: 2,0:21:43.47,0:21:51.30,720EN,but I have a different use case,0,0,0,,and so here with tabs we are accepting those items we map over those for both the buttons as well as the item contents
Dialogue: 1,0:21:52.00,0:21:58.35,720CN,but I have a different use case,0,0,0,,如果之后有人过来说 嘿 我希望按钮在下面，我们在做那种类似ios的风格
Dialogue: 2,0:21:52.00,0:21:58.35,720EN,but I have a different use case,0,0,0,,and then when that person comes along and says hey I want the buttons to be below, the contents we're doing some sort of iOS fake thing
Dialogue: 1,0:21:58.35,0:22:00.10,720CN,but I have a different use case,0,0,0,,所以我们希望按钮在下面，是吗？so we want the buttons below right
Dialogue: 1,0:22:00.50,0:22:05.72,720CN,,0,0,0,,tab item组件只是一个emotion组件，我们再把position设定为above
Dialogue: 2,0:22:00.50,0:22:05.72,720EN,,0,0,0,,and then this tab item is just an emotion component and so we'll say the position is above
Dialogue: 1,0:22:05.72,0:22:09.27,720CN,but I have a different use case,0,0,0,,这就会改变这个动画，让它指向正确的方向
Dialogue: 2,0:22:05.72,0:22:09.27,720EN,but I have a different use case,0,0,0,,and that will change that animation so it animates the right way
Dialogue: 1,0:22:10.30,0:22:14.37,720CN,,0,0,0,,实现这些功能我根本需要对base accordion做任何修改
Dialogue: 2,0:22:10.30,0:22:14.37,720EN,,0,0,0,,and with all of this we didn't have to change our base accordion at all
Dialogue: 1,0:22:14.37,0:22:19.25,720CN,but I have a different use case,0,0,0,,tabs组件的用户不需要关心它的实现，实际上tabs的底层复用了折叠菜单
Dialogue: 2,0:22:14.37,0:22:19.25,720EN,but I have a different use case,0,0,0,,and as far as the tabs is concerned we don't know that it's using the accordion under the hood
Dialogue: 1,0:22:19.62,0:22:26.15,720CN,but I have a different use case,0,0,0,,因为折叠菜单支持这些用例，tabs封装了实现的细节
Dialogue: 2,0:22:19.62,0:22:26.15,720EN,but I have a different use case,0,0,0,,because the accordion actually supports that usecase and tabs can kind of abstract away that implementation detail
Dialogue: 1,0:22:26.97,0:22:32.30,720CN,but I have a different use case,0,0,0,,封装性是我们如此热爱React的一个原因，谢谢
Dialogue: 2,0:22:26.97,0:22:32.30,720EN,but I have a different use case,0,0,0,,which is one of the reasons we love react so much is because we can do that so thank you guys
